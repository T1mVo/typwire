# typwire

Typed data exchange between Typst and (Rust) WASM plugins.

## Installation

Add the Rust crate to a plugin:

```sh
cargo add typwire
```

Add the Typst package to a document:

```typ
#import "@preview/typwire:0.2.0"
```

## Quick Start

Export a plugin function from Rust:

```rust
use typwire::{Length, initiate_protocol};

initiate_protocol!();

#[typwire::export]
fn measure(label: String, scale: f64) -> Result<(String, Length), String> {
    Ok((format!("{label}{scale}"), Length::new(12.0 * scale)))
}
```

Call the plugin function from Typst:

```typ
#import "@preview/typwire:0.2.0"

#let plugin = plugin("plugin.wasm")
#let (text, width) = typwire.call(plugin.measure, "Value: ", 1.5)

#assert(text == "Value: 1.5")
#assert(width == 18pt)
```

## Reference

### `typwire`

```typ
/// Call a typed Typwire plugin function with positional arguments, using
/// the given wire format -- the plugin export and the call site must agree
/// on the same one.
///
/// Each argument is encoded independently and the returned bytes are
/// decoded.
///
/// -> any
#let call(
  /// The plugin function to call.
  ///
  /// -> function
  function,
  /// Positional arguments to encode and pass.
  ///
  /// -> any
  ..args,
  /// The wire format to call with -- one of `"cbor"` (the default,
  /// matching `#[typwire::export]`'s own default), `"json"`.
  ///
  /// -> str
  format: "cbor",
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// Encode a Typst value into a wire format's bytes/string.
///
/// -> bytes | str
#let encode(
  /// The value to encode.
  ///
  /// -> any
  value,
  /// The wire format to encode into -- one of `"cbor"` (the default,
  /// matching `#[typwire::export]`'s own default), `"json"`. Use
  /// `typwire.debug.encode` instead to inspect the shared tree with no
  /// serialization at all.
  ///
  /// -> str
  format: "cbor",
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// The mirror of `encode`: decode a wire format's bytes/string and
/// reconstruct supported native Typst values.
///
/// -> any
#let decode(
  /// The encoded Typwire value.
  ///
  /// -> bytes | str
  data,
  /// The wire format `data` was encoded with -- must match.
  ///
  /// -> str
  format: "cbor",
) = { /* .. */ }
```

### `typwire.debug`

Useful for inspecting or testing the wire shape Typwire produces without going through an actual format or a plugin round trip.

```typ
/// Encode a value into the shared dictionary/array/primitive tree
/// `typwire.<format>.encode` would otherwise hand to a native format
/// encoder -- with no serialization step applied, so the result is a plain
/// Typst value, not `bytes`/`str`. Useful for inspecting or testing the
/// wire shape Typwire produces without a plugin round trip.
///
/// `bytes` is the one part of this tree that's still format-sensitive
/// (CBOR keeps it native; JSON tags it), so `format` picks which format's
/// tagging rules to preview -- it's otherwise unrelated to serialization,
/// which this namespace never does.
///
/// -> any
#let encode(
  /// The value to encode.
  ///
  /// -> any
  value,
  /// Which format's tagging rules to preview for `bytes`. One of `"cbor"`,
  /// `"json"`.
  ///
  /// -> str
  format: "cbor",
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// The mirror of `encode`: reconstruct native Typst values from a tree that
/// was never serialized, such as one produced by `encode` above.
///
/// -> any
#let decode(
  /// A dictionary/array/primitive tree, as produced by `encode`.
  ///
  /// -> any
  data,
  /// The format `data`'s tree was produced for -- must match whatever
  /// `encode` (or a real `typwire.<format>.encode`) used to build it, so
  /// `bytes` tags are resolved the same way they were tagged.
  ///
  /// -> str
  format: "cbor",
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// Encode a value into a JSON string.

/// "json")`, in the same recursive pass as everything else.
///
/// -> str
#let encode(
  /// The value to encode.
  ///
  /// -> any
  value,
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// Decode a JSON string or bytes and reconstruct supported native Typst
/// values.
///
/// A plain `str` is coerced to `bytes` first -- Typst's own `json(...)`
/// treats a bare `str` argument as a *file path* to load, not inline
/// content, so passing `encode`'s own `str` output straight through would
/// silently try to read a file instead of decoding it.
///
/// -> any
#let decode(
  /// The encoded Typwire value.
  ///
  /// -> bytes | str
  data,
) = { /* .. */ }
```

```typ
/// Call a typed Typwire plugin function with positional arguments, using
/// JSON as the wire format.
///
/// Each argument is encoded independently and the returned bytes are
/// decoded. Plugin calls require `bytes` arguments, so each encoded string
/// is wrapped with `bytes(..)` before the call.
///
/// -> any
#let call(
  /// The plugin function to call.
  ///
  /// -> function
  function,
  /// The positional arguments to pass to the function.

## Wire shapes

The actual Typst dictionary each tagged type above round-trips as: The
same shape `typwire.debug.encode` returns.

Inside a color or gradient, the
enclosing tag already says what each field is, so nested ratios and angles
are bare floats there (a fraction, and radians) rather than tagged
dictionaries of their own.

Native primitives (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `none`, `array`,
`dictionary`) aren't repeated here; they pass through untagged.

#### Foundations

##### Auto

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "auto")
```

##### Type

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "type", ty: "int")
```

##### Label

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "label", name: "intro")
```

##### Version

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "version", components: (1, 2, 3))
```

##### Symbol

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "symbol",
  default: "→",
  variants: ((modifiers: "double", glyph: "⇒"),),
)
```

**Note:** `symbol` uses `repr()` to access the variants, whose output is unstable and might change any time. Use this type with caution. 

##### Path

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "path", path: "assets/logo.svg")
```

**Note:** `path` uses `repr()` to recover its text, whose output is unstable and might change any time. Use
this type with caution.

##### Regex

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "regex", pattern: "\d+")
```

**Note:** `regex` uses `repr()` to recover its pattern, whose output is unstable and might change any time. Use
this type with caution. Requires the `regex` feature on the Rust side.

##### Decimal

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "decimal", decimal: "3.14")
```

**Note:** Requires the `decimal` feature on the Rust side.

##### Datetime

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "datetime",
  year: 2024,
  month: 1,
  day: 1,
  hour: none,
  minute: none,
  second: none,
)
```

##### Duration

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "duration", seconds: 3600.0)
```

##### Arguments

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "arguments", pos: (1, "two"), named: (flag: true))
```

##### Bytes

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "bytes", data: (1, 2, 3))
```

**Note:** Only used by JSON; CBOR keeps a native byte string.

#### Layout

##### Angle

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "angle", radians: 1.5707963267948966)
```

##### Length

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "length", points: 28.35)
```

##### Ratio

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "ratio", ratio: 0.5)
```

##### Alignment

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "alignment", x: "left", y: none)
```

#### Visualize

##### Color

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "color-luma", lightness: 1.0, alpha: 1.0)
```

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "color-rgb", r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, alpha: 1.0)
```

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "color-linear-rgb", r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, alpha: 1.0)
```

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "color-cmyk", cyan: 0.0, magenta: 1.0, yellow: 1.0, key: 0.0)
```

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "color-hsl",
  hue: 0.0,
  saturation: 1.0, lightness: 0.5, alpha: 1.0,
)
```

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "color-hsv",
  hue: 0.0,
  saturation: 1.0, value: 1.0, alpha: 1.0,
)
```

```typ
#let shape = (typwire-type: "color-oklab", lightness: 0.63, a: 0.22, b: 0.13, alpha: 1.0)
```

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "color-oklch",
  lightness: 0.63, chroma: 0.26,
  hue: 0.72,
  alpha: 1.0,
)
```

##### Gradient

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "gradient-linear",
  stops: ((color: (typwire-type: "color-rgb", r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, alpha: 1.0), offset: 0.0),),
  angle: 0.0,
  space: "rgb",

#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "gradient-conic",
  stops: (/* stop, stop, ... */),
  angle: 0.0,
  center: (x: 0.5, y: 0.5),
  space: "rgb",
)
```

##### Stroke

```typ
#let shape = (
  typwire-type: "stroke",
  paint: (typwire-type: "color-rgb", r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, alpha: 1.0),
  thickness: (typwire-type: "length", points: 1.0),
  cap: "round",
  join: "round",
  dash: none,
  miter-limit: 4.0,
)
```

## Performance

If you're considering moving a pure-Typst implementation to a WASM plugin
via typwire, be aware of the performance overhead that comes with it:

These measurements were taken with medium-sized data, like a gradient with 9 stops. Performance scales directly with the size of the data.

- **~10 ms** to load the plugin. Paid once per compilation, no matter how
  many times it's called afterward.
- **~1 ms** extra for the first call specifically, before per-call cost
  settles.
- **~150 μs** per call after that.

If no specific format is desired, or performance matters, use CBOR. JSON is
measurably slower:

| Format | Relative speed |
| :-: | :-: |
| CBOR | 1x (baseline) |
| JSON | ~2.5x |

### Comparison with sertyp

[sertyp](https://typst.app/universe/package/sertyp) solves a similar problem and
is considerably more feature-rich (for example, it can serialize `content`,
functions and styles, which typwire deliberately does not). typwire instead
specializes in performance. Time spent on the plugin round trip, CBOR only:

| Workload | typwire | sertyp | Speedup |
| :- | -: | -: | -: |
| 6000 integers | ~14 ms | ~943 ms | ~66x |
| 1000 small dictionaries | ~26 ms | ~372 ms | ~14x |
| 300 calls, one gradient each | ~54 ms | ~993 ms | ~18x |
| 40 kB of bytes | ~9 ms | ~19 ms | ~2x |

sertyp also fails on larger payloads (a few thousand nodes) because its
deserializer hits Typst's loop-iteration limit. See the full
[benchmark results](benchmarks/RESULT.md) for more workloads and how they were
measured.
