// Matches one escape sequence: a backslash followed by either `u{HEX}`

// `"`/`\`, dispatched on in `unescape-repr-content` below).
//
// This has to be *one* pattern applied in a *single* `.replace()` pass, not
// several independent `.replace()` calls one after another: with several
// passes, an escaped backslash immediately followed by a literal `n`/`t`/
// `r`/`"` (e.g. the string `\d\n`, four characters -- backslash, d,
// backslash, n -- repr'd as `\\d\\n`) gets corrupted, because the second
// pass's `\n` search matches across the boundary the first pass already
// consumed (turning the trailing literal `n` into an actual newline
// instead of leaving it alone). A single combined pattern can't do that,
// since each match consumes the characters it covers and matching resumes
// only after it -- confirmed by reproducing the corruption with the naive
// multi-pass version and then verifying this one against it, empirically,
// since path text can never contain a backslash but regex patterns are
// full of them.
